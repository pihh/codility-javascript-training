  Exercise 1
  Problem: Consider n coins aligned in a row. Each coin is showing heads at the beginning.
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  Then, n people turn over corresponding coins as follows. Person i reverses coins with numbers
  that are multiples of i. That is, person i flips coins i, 2 · i, 3 · i, . . . until no more appropriate
  coins remain. The goal is to count the number of coins showing tails. In the above example,
  the final configuration is:
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
