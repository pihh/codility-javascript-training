# Codility lessons solved with documented strategy
100% scored ( or at least the best I could ) javascript solution for all the codility lesson's exercises with a detailed description of the algorithm and strategy used.

[TOC]

## Steps to solve algorithms
    - **Understand the problem**: Take your time to effectively understand the problem.
    - **Run through the solution**: Recreate the steps necessary to solve the problem.
    - **Brute force it**: Brute force works. Better workng than noting.
    - **Improve it**: After finding a brute force solution try to improve it by removing nested loops, improving memory consumption and so on.
    - **Test for edge cases**: Test small examples, try to find edge cases and test them.
