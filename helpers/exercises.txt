GCD & LCM
- To solve space issues (to stock two quantities of different dimensions).
- Helps to find commonality. 2*3=6, 3*2=6 as well, we can use either 2 three times or 3 two times to bring a six. Cases where you need to distribute, what if the same 10 chocolates were to be give to five kids instead of 2?
- We find their use in measurements and construction fields.
- If we have LCM and GCD, we can find the product of numbers.
