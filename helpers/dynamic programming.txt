Dynamic programming is a method by which a solution is determined based on solving
successively similar but smaller problems. This technique is used in algorithmic tasks in
which the solution of a bigger problem is relatively easy to find, if we have solutions for its
sub-problems

Examples is to create tables ( hash tables to solve problems )
